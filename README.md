# Tap Out

## Inspiration
The inspiration came from the idea of creating a simple yet addictive game where players unlock cubes through strategic clicks. I focused on building a visually appealing experience using modern technologies and a gameplay mechanic that is simple but challenging.

## What it does
Tap Out is a puzzle game where the goal is to unlock all the cubes while carefully managing your attempts. Each cube requires a click to unlock, and some have arrows indicating special effects, adding a strategic component to the game.

## How we built it
The project was built using:
- **Svelte**: To manage the game logic and user interface.
- **Three.js**: For rendering the 3D environment.
- **Threlte**: To efficiently integrate Three.js into Svelte.
- **Devvit**: I learned to use this library to deploy and host the project on Reddit's platform.

## Challenges we ran into
- Properly implementing interactions between cubes and arrow effects was challenging, especially synchronizing the game logic.
- Integrating Devvit to deploy on Reddit required learning a new library and solving compatibility issues.
- Optimizing the 3D rendering performance to ensure smooth gameplay.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully combined Svelte, Three.js, and Threlte to create a visually appealing and functional game.
- Learned how to use Devvit, allowing me to deploy the game on Reddit.
- Developed engaging gameplay mechanics that challenge players to use logic and strategy.

## What we learned
- How to use Threlte to integrate Three.js into Svelte projects.
- Deploying applications using Devvit on Reddit.
- Improving game logic in interactive projects and handling events in 3D environments.

## What's next for Tap Out
- **New Levels**: Add more puzzles with increasing difficulty and diverse mechanics.
- **Customization**: Allow users to customize the appearance of cubes or the game environment.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Implement a mode where players can compete for higher scores.
- **Optimization**: Continue improving performance and compatibility for lower-end devices.
